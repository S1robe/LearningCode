# Tuples are collecitons that we cannot change them, and order matters ()

# Lists are [] standard accesses

# Dictionaries are {} and are closer to maps than anything else
# Changeable unordered and unique key:value pairs


# Sets also use {} and they are unordered, unindexed and will not have duplicates.
#   They also will not be in the same order when you access them necessary, but they will always have the items they have
# We can perform the usual methods on them, update for add, remove for rem, union for merger, difference, intersection etc.
